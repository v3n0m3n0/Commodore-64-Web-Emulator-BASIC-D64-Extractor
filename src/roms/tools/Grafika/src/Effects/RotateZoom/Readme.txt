Rotate / Zoom Effect DLL for Timanthes (v1.1 and later)
-------------------------------------------------------
This project serves as an example of how to create a Timanthes Effect
Plugin.

To build the Rotate / Zoom project without building Timanthes, you must fix
the references to PdnLib.dll and PaintDotNet.Effects.dll:

1. Open the RotateZoom.csproj file with Visual Studio .NET 2003
2. In the Solution Explorer, expand the References node. 
   Here you should see 5 references, two of which may yellow triangle 
   exclamation icons by them. 
3. Delete those two references.
4. Right click on References and select "Add Reference ..."
5. Click "Browse ..."
6. Navigate to the directory where you installed Timanthes.
7. Add both "PdnLib.dll" and "PaintDotNet.Effects.dll"

Now when you build RotateZoom, copy its DLL to the "Effects" directory that
is in the directory you installed Timanthes to. This is commonly located
at "C:\Program Files\Timanthes v...\Effects".
