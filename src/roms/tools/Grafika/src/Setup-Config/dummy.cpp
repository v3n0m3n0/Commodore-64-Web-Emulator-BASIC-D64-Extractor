    This program/project is just a dummy program whose real purpose lies in
    the pre-build events which are used to config the Timanthes.msi file
    in ways that can't otherwise be automated.

    Currently we:

    1. Change the .msi from "Install for Just Me" to "Install for Everyone."
       This is accomplished using a VB-Script that executes an SQL query.

    2. Packages together the .NET 1.1 installer and the PaintDotNet.msi along
       with the ".NET Bootstrapper" (downloadable @ MSDN) that installs .NET
       (if required) and then installs PDN. These are packaged into a self-
       extracting EXE using Nullsoft's Scriptable Install System. See the file
       MakeFullSetup.nsi for more info.
